<h3 id="naive-approach">Naive approach</h3>
<p>Algorithm for the naive approach:</p>
<pre><code>parse input -&gt; a [][]bool painted such that painted[i][j] is true if pixel (i, j) is black.
[]string operations
for i in painted height
    for j in painted width
        if painted[i][j] is true then
            append &quot;FILL,j,i,1&quot; to back of operations list
write each element of operations to file</code></pre>

<pre><code>parse input -&gt; a [][]bool painted such that painted[i][j] is true if pixel (i, j) is black.
initialize a visited [][]bool of same size than painted such that visited[i][j] is true if painted[i][j] was visited

    for j in painted width
        if visited[i][j] then do nothing
        else if painted[i][j] then

<p>Other ideas that were not implemented:</p>
<ul>
<li>count black and white cell, if black &gt; white then fill only else one fill then only erase</li>
<li>dynamic programming approach, solve pb for painting of incrementing size</li>
</ul>
